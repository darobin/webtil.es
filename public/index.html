        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          Tiles are composable web docs and apps that can safely be used in arbitrary
          contexts and assembled from multiple sources to carry out complex user
          interface tasks. Their composability, security, and privacy properties
          make them ideal for use in social media, chat, agents, and malleable
          software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building on the <a href="https://dasl.ing/">DASL</a> specification toolbox
          brings the power of content addressing to tiles, and makes them excellent
          for use in contexts such as the <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For JS environments, there's a whole box of tools that you can use to
          support and manipulate tiles in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dasl/tiles"><code>@dasl/tiles</code></a>
          package.

        <h2>Demos</h2>
        <p>
          It's still pretty early days and we're still in the process of making
          demos. There isn't much yet — but we'll keep adding, and you can add
          yours too!
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><a href="/demos/at/">Core Tiles (AT and CAR)</a></dt>
          <dd>
            Tiles are typically loaded from AT Proto, but they can also be stored
            in a CAR file. This has the downside of requiring the entire archive
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="/demos/xdc/">WebXDC</a></dt>
          <dd>
            The <code>@dasl/tiles</code> library supports loading from pluggable
            sources, and one of them is <a href="https://webxdc.org/">WebXDC</a>.
            These are not technically tiles but they're relatively close. We
            don't emulate all the chat features that they have (but that could be
            added).

        <h2>Decision Tree</h2>
        <p>
          The design of web tiles can be surprising to people who are used to
          typical apps. A core part of the model is that, while they can have
          access to relatively powerful capabilities, they are completely cut off
          from network access beyond loading their own pre-declared dependencies
          (and barring gating access through specific user action).
        </p>
        <p>
          This can feel restrictive, but two things mitigate those restrictions.
          First, depending on context, tiles can be granted access to functions
          that allow them to perform things that regular pages cannot, such as
          communicating with other instances of the same tile in a chat or
          invoking other tiles. And second — and most importantly — this
          restriction makes new applications possible. In many cases it's simply
          inconceivable to run a full-fledge web frame simply because it could
          exfiltrate too much sensitive data too easily. But since tiles have very
          constrained exfiltration paths, they are safe for use in private
          environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          To better understand this, we've made a decision tree that maps the design
          space for embedded apps and docs. It’s worth pointing out that one
          decision that isn’t in the tree is about whether users should be prompted
          for access to powerful capabilities as a load-bearing component of access
          to anything dangerous, including exfiltration. It’s not there because a
          world in which that works doesn’t exist.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Do you want to build atop web technology?</dt>
          <dd>
            <u>No</u>. That’s respectable, good luck to you. You’ll probably
            have to pick trade-off from the rest of the tree, but they’ll depend
            a lot on the architectural fundamentals that you select and so it’s
            hard to discuss that in meaningful detail. You exit the tree here.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            <u>Yes</u>. Reuse is good. Painful, but good.
            <dl>
              <dt>What networking security model do you want?</dt>
              <dd>
                <u>At least partly arbitrary network access</u>. This may be
                somewhat restricted (SOP, CORS, etc.) but you can touch the network,
                which means that you can exfiltrate sensitive information from
                powerful APIs and generally violate privacy.
                <dl>
                  <dt>Is installation gated to verify some degree of safety of the content?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <u>No</u>. This is basically the web as supported by today’s
                    browsers. You can change some things about how it’s implemented,
                    what the UX is, but in general you will need to limit access
                    to many powerful features, you will need to be careful to
                    limit the loading of content not initially triggered by user
                    action, etc. Nothing new here.
                  </dd>
                  <dd>
                    <u>Yes</u>. This is an app store. We know where it ends.
                  </dd>
                </dl>
              </dd>
              <dd>
                <u>No network access beyond pre-determined content</u>. This makes
                it possible to expose much more powerful APIs and much more private
                information, up to and including granting access for instance to a
                full private chat. The lack of access to the network is limiting,
                but it also renders the system composable and predictable.
                <dl>
                  <dt>What kind of packaging tech do you use?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <u>Zip-like</u>. This is essentially WebXDC. It’s a fine approach
                    and has seen variants implemented. The downside is that loading
                    content becomes tied to loading the whole bundle or playing
                    challenging games with built-in Zip manifests and range requests.
                    It makes including large content (e.g. parquet, video) difficult
                    and in the general case it will murder the latency of your first
                    paint and interactivity.
                  </dd>
                  <dd>
                    <u>Manifest-like</u>. The limits to content loading are not
                    defined by a packaging format but by a manifest that will map
                    the bundle’s internal paths to loading mechanisms, ideally content
                    addressed. The full content can be bundled if desired (e.g. into
                    a CAR) but it can also be loaded through content-addressing
                    indirection mechanisms, for instance from a PDS over AT. This
                    is web tiles.
